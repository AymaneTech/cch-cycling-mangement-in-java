- **Infrastructure Layer**: Manages persistence and external services
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles REST controllers and request/response models

### Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Spring Framework (IoC, MVC, Data JPA)
- **ORM**: Hibernate
- **Database**: [Your Database Choice]
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
